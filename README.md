We introduce **LAMBDA**, a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that harnesses the power of large models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in complex data-driven applications through the use of innovatively designed data agents that operate iteratively and generatively using natural language.

## Key Features

- **Code-Free Data Analysis**: Perform complex data analysis tasks through human language instruction.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes two key agent roles, the programmer and the inspector, to generate and debug code seamlessly.
- **User Interface**: This includes a robust user interface that allows direct user intervention in the operational loop.
- **Model Integration**: Flexibly integrates external models and algorithms to cater to customized data analysis needs.
- **Automatic Report Generation**: Concentrate on high-value tasks, rather than spending time and resources on report writing and formatting.

## Performance

LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various machine learning datasets, enhancing data science practice and analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence.

## Demonstration Video

The performance of LAMBDA in solving data science problems is demonstrated in several case studies including:
- **[Data Analysis](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/files/lambda/lambda.mp4)**
- **[Integrating Human Intelligence](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/files/lambda/knw.mp4)**
- **[Education](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/files/lambda/LAMBDA_education.mp4)**
